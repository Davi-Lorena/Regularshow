## Overview ü¶ù
This project is a presentation of the main characters, such as Mordecai and Rigby, from the masterpiece "Regular Show", a cartoon that brings relevant stories and lessons for life, in addition to being excellent entertainment.

## About development üê¶
I developed this project during an event, at "Dev em Dobro", and this was my first contact with markup, style and programming languages. 
In this event, the characters were different and part of the structure too, factors that were changed by me. 
After completing this first challenge, I embarked on the world of programming with Rocketseat.

## Features :lollipop:
- Responsive Layout
- Interesting information about the characters
